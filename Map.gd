# the scenery the battle takes place on. like the tile types eg sand or whatever. 

# battle will have a map so this passes up the generated active entities to the battle and store MapEntities for itself

# will recieve the players entities from the battle for the generation process
# will load a map type from various map files that each have an environment type.
# this class then generates the tileset for the battle
# all tiles will be a MapEntity for the purposes of destruction n stuff
